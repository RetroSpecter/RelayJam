Welcome to my directory. As my assistant, you'll see many things here...
It's really late and I'm really tired but I need to write up some notes. Here goes...

Potential Plot Synopsis:
There is a corporation making lemon-lime soda and they've awakened an evil demon.

---------------------------
        CHARACTERS
---------------------------
Ash Turbo (voiced by Lynsey Liu)
Our hero and main character. She is the pilot of the ship.
I gave her a wrench thinking maybe she's the only one who can activate certain
things like the steering wheel?
She is competent and confident, with low tolerance for bullshit.

Snap Jackson (voiced by Aaron Johnston)
You already know his character. A self-proclaimed "Space Entrepreneur."
Traveling with Ash because ???????
He has a gun.

Grok (voiced by Andrew Murray)
An escaped convict on the lam. Gruff on the outside, soft on the inside.
Traveling with Ash because ?????????
He has a fist.

Jed Rascal (voiced by Pavan Kumar)
Mysterious boi. Wrong time period.
I'm thinking he could be a guy you fight at first (to the cowboy version of the battle theme?)
...but then he joins your party.
See you space cowboy...

Robots
robots are cool

Scientist/Bodyguard
I'm thinking these guys work for the corporation that's developing lemon-lime
(both the soda and the demon snake creature)

---------------------------
        ANIMATIONS
---------------------------
Every character has a still standing pose, a getting hurt pose, and a 2-frame attack.
Enemies have a 2-frame walk, main characters have a 4-frame walk.
Main characters also have a pose where they're drinking lemon-lime soda.

---------------------------
       OTHER NOTES
---------------------------
There is a button called "enjoy refreshments" that kenji added.
I'm thinking that when that button is pressed the battle theme
switches to the "enjoy refreshments" theme and all the characters
switch to the sprite where they're drinking lemon-lime soda.
The "enjoy refreshments" theme lines up perfectly with the battle
theme to make this work.

The ambient aaron voiceline is just some extra audio from recording.

I didn't have time to do any sounds for the enemies, sorry :/
